# Play-chess

I have created a chessboard with C# as part of the programming with C# course of the University of Piraeus using windows form. This app allow players to play chess freely,ie no restriction is applied based on the rules of the game.The game gives also the opportunity to players to choose time that each one can have for moving a pawn.Application simulates real world chess games.
